    <h1>Hover Camera App Terms of Use</h1>

    <h2>Introduction.</h2>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in the Hover Camera application (the “Hover Camera App” or the or this “App”) offered by Zero Zero. (Zero Zero refers to Zero Zero companies and associated operating units relating to some services. “Zero Zero” or, as the context permits, “us” or “we”) for use in connection with the Hover Camera line of drone products (each, a “Hover Camera Product”) offered by Zero Zero.</p>
    <p>Please read and familiarize yourself with the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Use (these “App Terms” or these “Terms”), as they govern your rights and obligations, as well as our responsibilities and the limitations of our responsibilities and liability. By clicking “ACCEPT” or by using the Hover Camera App or any of the products, software or services provided to you through the Hover Camera App (together with the Hover Camera App, the “Services”), you are acknowledging that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms and the Hover Camera App Privacy Policy. Your right to use this App is expressly subject to these Terms by which your limited rights to download and use the App are established. If you are not eligible to operate a Hover Camera Product or do not agree to any of these Terms, then you may not use the App or any of the other Services.</p>
    <p>In order to use the Services, you will need (i) to have purchased or otherwise have access to a Hover Camera Product, (ii) to have accepted these Terms; and (iii) to have downloaded this App for the purpose of accessing and using the Services, all as explained in these Terms.</p>
    <p>These Terms apply to users of the Hover Camera App or any of the related Services in connection with Zero Zero unmanned aerial vehicle (“UAV” or “drone”) products, but do not apply to the products themselves. Terms governing the products themselves, including the Manufacturer’s Limited Warranty and Refund & Exchange Policy are provided in “hard copy” at the time a Hover Camera Product is purchased and delivered, and such policies are also available on the Manufacturer’s website, which can be found at:</p>
    <p class="link"><a href="https://www.gethover.com/support">GetHover.com/support</a></p>

    <h2>Hover Camera App; the Services.</h2>
    <p>The Hover Camera App is made available under these Terms only to those who have accepted these Terms and is intended to enable you to control your Hover Camera Product and to enjoy its various features in flight, including the auto-follow feature and the pre-programmed flight path modes. The Hover Camera App will enable you to download photos or videos to your Smartphone or other enabled device taken by the cameras onboard your Hover Camera Product.</p>

    <h2>Eligibility.</h2>
    <p>You must be at least the age of majority where you reside or where you intend to use the Hover Camera Product and the Hover Camera App, or be over the age of fourteen (14) and closely supervised by someone over the age of majority, if permitted by applicable law, to use any of the Services, including the Hover Camera App. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us, and agree that: (a) you are at least the applicable age of majority or, if permitted by applicable law, are at least fourteen (14) years of age and being closely supervised by someone over the age of majority; (b) you have not previously been suspended or barred from use of the Services; and (c) you are and will remain in compliance with all applicable laws where you reside or where you intend to use the Services for the purpose of controlling or interacting with a Hover Camera Product including, without limitation, any licensing or registration requirements; and (d) your use of the Services is and will be in compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations. If you are using the Services for commercial or other purposes on behalf of an entity, such as a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, governmental agency or any other entity, whether or not such entity is organized as a for-profit or not-for-profit entity, you are representing and warranting to us that you have the full authority to bind that entity to these Terms and that, by your use of the Hover Camera App or any of the other Services, you are binding such entity to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Using the Hover Camera App to Operate a Hover Camera Product.</h2>
    <p>By accessing the Hover Camera App to control a Hover Camera Product, or to access any of the other Services available now or hereafter through the Hover Camera App, you are agreeing that: (a) you will only use a Hover Camera Product in strict accordance with all applicable laws and regulations governing the ownership, registration, use and operation of UAVs where you use the drone, and always in compliance with the applicable Hover Camera Product Disclaimers and Safety Instructions and user manual provided by Zero Zero; (b) you will not use any Hover Camera Product in any illegal manner or for any illegal purpose in violation of any applicable international or U.S. federal, state, or local law or regulation; (c) you will not (and will not cause or permit others to) remove, deface, or otherwise obscure any regulatory or certification markers affixed to any Hover Camera Product; and (d) you understand that the obligations to repair any Hover Camera Product or component thereof is governed by the Manufacturer’s Limited Warranty and Refund & Exchange Policy provided by the Manufacturer to (and only for the benefit of) the original owner of a Hover Camera Product.</p>

    <h2>Compliance with Laws.</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that your operation of a Hover Camera Product complies at all times with applicable laws, statutes, rules and regulations as the operator of the drone. Such regulations may be issued under the auspices of a Federal agency, such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”), or by State, local or municipal governments. These laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but can change rapidly, and jurisdictions that only recently had no or few such regulations “on the books” have adopted new or additional regulations and may in the future adopt, change or supplement their regulations that govern the ownership and operation of UAVs.</p>
    <p>Such laws and regulations typically govern who and under what circumstances UAVs may be piloted, and often require registration of UAVs. For example, currently the FAA’s Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) Registration System mandates the registration of any UAV weighing between 0.55 pounds (250 grams) and 55 pounds (25 kg). In the United States, failure to register a UAV with the FAA when required could result in both criminal and civil penalties.  Some laws or local regulations may require the licensing of operators. Many distinguish between recreational and commercial use of UAVs. Some divide UAVs into classes by weight and have different rules applicable to each. Some regulations are directed, due to privacy concerns, to the use of drones which, like the Hover Camera Product, are capable of capturing still and/or video photography or live streaming. Such regulations may dictate the altitudes or altitude ranges at or within which drones may or must be operated (and typically impose height limitations), and many require that the operator must keep the drone within his or her line of sight at all times while the drone is in operation. Many establish excluded zones or identify certain types of facilities in, near or over which drones may not be operated, such as within a certain proximity to any airports or military facilities or near utilities and power transmission lines.</p>
    <p>As noted, it is the responsibility of the operator alone to ensure that while using the Hover Camera App to control a Hover Camera Product he or she complies with all applicable laws and regulations governing the ownership, use and operation of UAVs. Neither the Hover Camera App nor any of the other Services offered by us or the Manufacturer provides legal guidance or legal advice about who may operate, and where, when and under what circumstances a Hover Camera Product so as to comply with applicable law. These Terms do not constitute or provide, and are no substitute for your obtaining, competent legal advice concerning applicable laws and regulations governing your ownership and the operation of drones in the jurisdiction where you reside or in any other location in which you operate or intend to operate your Hover Camera Product.</p>
    <p>Additional restrictions or limitations on operations of a Hover Camera Product may arise from differences in regulations based on whether the UAV is being operated for personal versus commercial use. Flying a Hover Camera Product over the private property of any person or entity without the property owner’s prior express permission, regardless of the purpose, is likely to be prohibited as trespass and possibly as an invasion of privacy. Please be aware that even when operating your Hover Camera Product in areas lawfully permitted for operation of a UAV, as the operator you alone are fully responsible for the safe flight of the Hover Camera Product which means, at a minimum, maintaining appropriate distances from other aircraft, not flying the drone near people or animals, and not flying the drone under conditions where, due to the weather or other variables, you may not be able to adequately control the flight and safe landing of your Hover Camera Product.</p>
    <p>In the event that you have any questions about the restrictions that govern the ownership, use or operation of drones in your area (which could relate to altitude restrictions or specific “no-fly” zones, hours of permitted operation, etc.), you should contact your local authorities for guidance.</p>
    <p>For further information concerning the use of a UAV, you are encouraged to visit website before you begin operation of your Hover Camera Product.</p>

    <h2>Additional Restrictions.</h2>
    <p>Before using the Hover Camera App to operate a Hover Camera Product, you are urged to review carefully and familiarize yourself with the Manufacturer’s detailed Disclaimer and Safety Instructions that was originally provided to the purchaser of the Hover Camera Product at the time of the product’s delivery. Those instructions provide important guidance on the operation of the Hover Camera Product and also can be found on the Manufacturer’s website, as well:</p>
    <p class="link"><a href="https://www.gethover.com/support">GetHover.com/support</a></p>
    <p>By downloading and accepting these Terms, and then using the Hover Camera App to operate a Hover Camera Product, you are agreeing for the benefit of Zero Zero and its affiliates (including without limitation the Manufacturer) to abide by Zero Zero safety instructions when handling, operating and flying any Hover Camera Product via the Hover Camera App. You must not attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any of the source code of the software that controls or contributes to the delivery of any of the Services, nor copy or duplicate any of the Services whether or not for a purpose that would be competitive with the Services offered hereunder.</p>


    <h2>Modification of the Services.</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, to disable or suspend the Services or to modify these Terms, the Hover Camera App and/or any of the other Services offered hereby or through use of the App. Any such suspensions may be for diagnostic or routine system maintenance purposes, for upgrades, or to cooperate with law enforcement or other authorities. Please check this Hover Camera App from time to time to make certain that you are aware of, and familiar with, the most current version. Any modifications we make to these App Terms or to the Hover Camera App and related Services may add to or take away from the features then currently available through the Hover Camera App. Any material changes will be introduced with advance notice before such changes become effective, and notice of such changes will provided in these App Terms and/or on the Zero Zero website, unless immediate effectiveness is required to comply with applicable law or for an identified safety, security or similar issue. If, after we modify these App Terms, you continue using the Hover Camera App, your continued use will constitute evidence of your acceptance of these App Terms as modified. Accordingly, if after any such modification of these App Terms you do not agree to be bound by them as modified, you must immediately discontinue your use of the Hover Camera App, delete or uninstall the App from your device, because any use made of the Hover Camera App after each such modification will be subject to these App Terms as so modified and will signify your acceptance of these Terms with such modifications.</p>

    <h2>Accounts.</h2>
    <p>In the future, Zero Zero may require any users of the Hover Camera App to establish an account with us in order to continue having access to the Hover Camera App and the other Services as a means of monitoring certain aspects of customers’ use of the Hover Camera Products and the Hover Camera App. In the event that we elect in the future to require you to establish an account, we will alert those who have downloaded and used the Hover Camera App and will provide further guidance, along with a separate Hover Camera App Privacy Policy for any personally identifiable information that we may collect or obtain as a result of users of the Hover Camera App establishing accounts and using the Hover Camera App through such accounts.</p>
    <p>Whether or not we change these App Terms to require that users establish a Zero Zero account in order to use the Hover Camera App and any related Services, your right to use the Hover Camera App is expressly conditioned on your compliance with these Terms including, without limitation (i) your acceptance of these Terms; (ii) your acceptance of these Terms as they may from time to time be modified, (iii) your operation of the Hover Camera Product at all times strictly in compliance with applicable law; (iv) your use of this App solely in compliance with the terms and limitations of these Terms; (v) your use of the Hover Camera product only for lawful purposes, and (vi) your observance of the specific Safety Instructions provided by Zero Zero to the original purchaser of a Hover Camera Product at the time of such product’s delivery.</p>

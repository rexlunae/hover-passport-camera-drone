    <h1>Hover Camera App Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: April 8th, 2017</p>
    <p>This Policy describes the information that Zero Zero. (“Zero Zero” or, as the context permits, “us” or “we”) receives and collects from you when you download and use the Zero Zero Hover Camera application (the “Hover Camera App” or “the App”) for use in connection with the Hover Camera line of drone products. This Policy tells you what information we currently collect through your use of the App, what we do with such information and under what circumstances (and with whom) we may share such information.</p>
    <p>Before you can download and use the Hover Camera App, you are encouraged to review the related Terms of Use and all of the terms of this Policy, and you are required to affirmatively acknowledge and agree to be bound by such Terms of Use and this Policy in order to use the App. If, for any reason, you do not agree with the Terms of Use applicable to the App, or to this Policy concerning our collection and use of your information, you may not download or use the App, and you should not click on the “I Agree” button found at the bottom of the Terms of Use. By clicking the “I Agree” button found at the end of the Terms of Use, it will confirm and evidence your review, understanding and acceptance of those Terms of Use and this Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information that We Collect and How We Use It.</h2>
    <p>Notice: your Hover Camera product will automatically record the following informations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect the way you use the app and the features you use in order to optimize our app and the interaction experience.</li>
        <li>Related facial information will be collected and upload to server when you use the face recognition feature in order to optimize algorithm and improve the accuracy of face recognition.</li>
        <li>If the product fails to track you when you use the face-tracking or body-tracking mode, the pictures before the failure will be upload to the server in order to optimize the robustness of auto tracking;</li>
        <li>Hover Camera will automatically intercept the current screen shot and save the data in the system in the process of using the product; but these images will not be uploaded to the server, they are only used in the after-sale process to find problems or determining the responsibility.</li>
        <li>When users use the App to provide shared information to the third party through our services, or if they store some information when using our services, these kinds of information will be collected.</li>
        <li>Shared information provided by other third parties when they use our services will be collected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each time you use the App, we need to determine your location via the geolocation (GPS) feature of your Smart phone or other mobile device to allow the App to determine which Wi-Fi channel or bandwidth is appropriate for controlling your Hover Camera product in your then-current location. The SDK we used in the app may collect certain information automatically including, but without limitation, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, your preferred language, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the App.  This information will only be used for the development and optimization of product features and will not be disclosed or disclosed in any form without the authorization of the user.</p>
    <p>By using the App, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge and agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the App through the technologies described above, as well as similar technologies developed in the future.</p>
    <p>If you choose to register with us when downloading the App, we will obtain whatever information you provide to us (some of which is required to establish your registration and is marked with an asterisk (*), and other information, even if a field is made available for completion, is entirely voluntary). Please note that, currently, registration with us is completely optional and is not required in order to use the App (but clicking the “I Agree” button at the end of the Terms of Use to signify your acceptance of the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy is required in order to use the App). It is possible that you may not be able to use some of the features offered by the App, now or in the future, unless you register with us. The App does not seek to access your phone book or contact lists, nor to identify any other mobile applications that you may have downloaded onto the Smart phone or other device onto which you have downloaded and are using the App.</p>
    <p>If, in the future, we begin to allow users to post content to the Zero Zero website (so-called “user generated content,” or “UGC”) through the App, individuals who want to use the App for such a purpose or to communicate with us will be required to register with us and create accounts, which will entail setting up account passwords and log-in credentials. In the process of providing us with the information required to establish an account with us, you will be asked to provide us with certain personally identifable information that we will receive, retain, use and share only in accordance with this Policy, as the Policy may be changed by us from time to time.</p>
    <p>Similarly, if we modify the App to allow users to send or share photos or videos to or with others, or to post photos or video to social media platforms directly, we would expect to be collecting additional information about your social media accounts and contacts.</p>
    <p>Currently, our principal use of any information that we collect from you and others through your and their use of the App is to facilitate operation of the App and to determine trends or issues in use of the App that will allow us to improve or refine the App or any support features that we might offer. We also may use the information collected to assist the Manufacturer in changing or adding new features or capabilities to its line of Hover Camera products, or even to develop new products based upon what we learn from users’ use of the App.</p>

    <h2>When and to Whom We Disclose Information.</h2>
    <p>Except as described in this Policy, generally we do collect or disclose to third parties any personally identifiable information of App users obtained through the App, without your consent. We may disclose information that you provide to us or that we collect automatically as described above to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <p>We may disclose information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>when required by law, such as to comply with current or future regulations binding upon us, or to comply with a subpoena, government request or similar legal process;</li>
        <li>when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, or to investigate fraud;</li>
        <li>to any service providers that work on our behalf (such as those providing further development of the App or related applications, web hosting, geolocation or other functionality inherent in the App, etc.), do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this Policy (in other words, they cannot make different uses or make disclosures of your information that we are not permitted to make under this Policy); or</li>
        <li>if we were to become involved in a merger, acquisition or sale of all or a portion of our assets, we might be expected to share information concerning our App users with such merger partner or purchaser, but in that case we would expect such third party to agree to an appropriate confidentiality undertaking and we will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or in uses of your information. At that time, we also would notify you as to any choices that you may have regarding such information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we or our affiliates share your personal information with any of the third parties, we will work to ensure that such third parties comply with the "privacy policy" in the use of your personal information to we require them to comply with other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>


    <h2>Your Right to Opt Out or Update any Information Provided:</h2>
    <p>You can opt out and stop all collection of information via the App easily by uninstalling the App from each device onto which you have downloaded it. You may use the standard uninstall processes that may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network. You can also request to opt-out by sending us an email (with “Opt-Out” in the subject line), to:</p>
    <p class="link">support@GetHover.com</p>
    <p>If you decline to share any information with us – for example, if you disable the geolocation feature that enables the App to find the correct Wi-Fi channel when you want to communicate with the Hover Camera product.– it is possible for the users to violate the local rules and regulations about restrictions of Wi-Fi bandwidth.</p>
    <p>If you provided us with personal information in connection with the App, you may update, correct, or delete certain such information by accessing your account preferences page on our website. Please note that while we will use reasonable efforts to effect any changes you may indicate within a reasonable period of time, we may retain any information that you previously submitted in our archives for prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate right or reason to do so. In addition, if we have provided any of your personal information to third parties as described in this Policy, those parties’ retention of that information will be subject to their retention policies.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Controlling a Hover Camera via the App is intended for mature users over the age of fourteen (14), and is not intended for or directed to children under the age of fourteen (14). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of fourteen (14) without obtaining parental consent. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at support@GetHover.com. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time after receiving such notice.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personal information. The computers and servers in which we store any personally identifiable information of App users are located in a secure environment, and access to those computers and servers is restricted to those employees and others with a need to know for the purpose of performing their job-related responsibilities. Nonetheless, as news reports make clear on a regular basis, it seems that no security measures currently in use are perfect or impenetrable. For this reason, and despite our good faith efforts, we cannot and do not guarantee that all or any of your information will not be accessed, viewed, stolen, disclosed, altered or destroyed by a hacker seeking to overcome the safeguards that we employ to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Updates to this Policy</h2>
    <p>From time to time, we will update this Policy to comply with changes in applicable privacy laws and industry practices, so you should revisit this page on a regular basis to stay aware of our current Privacy Policy. When we modify this Policy, we will let you know on the App by indicating that there is a new revision available (and the date of that revision). If such changes involve significant modifications that materially change your rights, and especially if such changes would expand the type or extent of the personally identifiable information that we can collect from or about you, or expand our rights to disclose to others such information, we will make a reasonable effort to notify you of the change. Your continued use of the App after the revised Policy becomes effective will evidence your acknowledgment and agreement that you have read, understood and agreed to the then-current version of this Policy.</p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the App, you are consenting to our processing of your information as we have described in this Privacy Policy and, unless you opt out of and delete the App from your devices, in the manner in which this Policy may permit in the future if we update this Policy.  As used in the preceding sentence, "processing,” means using customary techniques (whether already in existence or developed hereafter) to, among other things, collect, store, delete, use, combine and disclose information, all of which activities will take place. By using the App, you (a) acknowledge that the data protection and other privacy laws of countries other than the United States, including the country in which you live if not in the United States, may provide a greater or lesser standard of protection for your information than that provided by the data protection and privacy laws of the United States, and (b) consent to your information being collected, processed and transferred as set forth in this Privacy Policy and applicable United States law.</p>
